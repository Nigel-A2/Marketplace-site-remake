We've loaded Beaver Builder up with a flexible set of content modules to aid you in building stunning layouts and landing pages within an intuitive drag and drop system. Beaver Builder also supports core and third party WordPress widgets and shortcodes, so you can use Beaver Builder with all your _other_ favorite plugins!

= A WordPress Page Builder That Works With Your Theme =

Yep, that's right! Beaver Builder was designed to work with almost any WordPress theme. Try Beaver Builder on your existing website today, or consider upgrading and using Beaver Builder's outstanding framework theme (available in Pro and Agency packages) for your next project.

= A WordPress Page Builder That's 100% Mobile Friendly =

Every part of a Beaver Builder layout or landing page is fully responsive and looks gorgeous on any screen size. Responsive web design has never been easier.

= A WordPress Page Builder That's Optimized For Performance =

We've designed Beaver Builder to create layouts and landing pages that load quickly. Many page builders load in an ungodly number of scripts and stylesheets to every page on your site. Not Beaver Builder! It only loads the assets needed for a given layout or landing page.
